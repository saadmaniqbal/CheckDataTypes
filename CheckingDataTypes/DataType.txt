For variables, it will not have a period/dot in it, so we can use that to seperate a command like append or insert from the name of the variable itself

if it starts with a def and has a space afterwards, its a function

equals to is either assignment or the result of an addition or a multiplication

quotations, either double or single, refers to characters or strings

if addition or multiplication is done, but not assigned, that is a warning

if a string is added to a number, it is an error

multiplication between two strings will result in an error

if two strings are being added, they will act as concatonation

if a previously string assigned variable is now assigned as a int, it will result a warning and vice versa


when arrays are present and empty, just include them inside storages

if a string array has int added to it, it will send a warning and vice versa

added two arrays will produce a warning if their datatypes do not align*

multiplication between two arrays will result in an error if they are not int and of the same numbers


if statements : comparison between two ints/strings like == >= <= < >, store it and check if both the variables are same datatype

take care of local variables


if a string and int is compared, then it is a warning

presence of exp and sqrt, their interior must be int
